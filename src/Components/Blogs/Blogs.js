                   <p className='ans'>The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on. Context is also touted as an easier, lighter approach to state management using Redux.</p>

                    <h1 className='question'>What is an inline-block element?</h1>
                    <p className='ans'>Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements, except they can have padding and margins added on all four sides. You'll have to declare display: inline-block in your CSS code. One common use for using inline-block is for creating navigation links horizontally, as shown below.</p>
